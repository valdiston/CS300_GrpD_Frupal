- If 'n', no terrain associated with the item
- Not sure how to separate the gold and energy from the other items, must be
	hard-coded elsewhere (first two items = energy/gold always)
- Not sure if terrain could just be left 'blank', instead of have the n character
- 'Value' for Gold/Energy means the starting amount. Otherwise it's the cost of the
	item in the game

Dictionary - Where key is the item name and value is a tuple
	containing the value of the item and the terrain it affects
